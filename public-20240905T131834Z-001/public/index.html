            <h2>What is Animation?</h2>
            <p>
                Animation is the process of creating motion and shape change illusions through a sequence of still images or frames. By displaying these images in quick succession, animation creates the illusion of movement, bringing static visuals to life. This technique is used in various forms of media, including films, television shows, and video games, to create engaging and dynamic content.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are several types of animation, including traditional hand-drawn animation, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and stop-motion animation. Each method has its own unique characteristics and applications. Animation principles such as timing, spacing, and easing are fundamental to creating realistic and appealing motion, enhancing the viewer's experience and storytelling effectiveness.

            <h2>What is 2D Animation?</h2>
            <p>
                2D animation is a technique where characters and scenes are created and animated in a two-dimensional space. This involves drawing or designing elements with height and width but no depth. By displaying a sequence of these drawings or designs quickly, the illusion of movement is created. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2D animation, artists often create individual frames by hand or digitally, and software tools are used to manage and display these frames in a smooth, continuous motion. This technique is widely used in various media, such as cartoons, television shows, and video games. It can range from traditional hand-drawn animations to modern digital methods, each with its own style and workflow.

            <h2>What is the Difference Between 2D and 3D Animation?</h2>
            <p>
                The main difference between 2D and 3D animation lies in their dimensionality and the techniques used to create them.
            </p>
            <h3>2D Animation:</h3>
            <p>
                2D animation is flat, meaning it exists in two dimensionsâ€”height and width. It creates the illusion of movement in a flat space. This type of animation involves creating characters and scenes in a two-dimensional space, often through drawing or digital design. Animators create a sequence of images or frames, which are played in succession to produce the appearance of movement. This technique is used in various media, including cartoons and TV shows.
            </p>
            <h3>3D Animation:</h3>
            <p>
                3D animation adds depth to the dimensionality, allowing for a more realistic representation of objects and characters. It involves creating models in a three-dimensional space using software. These models are manipulated and posed within a virtual environment to produce animations. The process includes modeling, texturing, rigging, animating, and rendering. 3D animation is commonly used in films, video games, and visual effects to achieve a more lifelike appearance.

                <h3>Concept and Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Start by defining the character's role, personality, and backstory. Research different sources for inspiration and gather ideas that will guide the visual design.
                </p>
                <h3>Character Design Elements</h3>
                <p>
                    Design facial features, clothing, and accessories that reflect the character's personality and role. Choose a color scheme that complements the character's traits.
                </p>
                <h3>Expression and Pose Sheets</h3>
                <p>
                    Create expression and pose sheets to show a range of emotions and behaviors. This helps in maintaining consistency and depth in the character's actions.
                </p>
                <h3>Character Turnarounds</h3>
                <p>
                    Develop character turnaround sheets with different views to ensure consistent character design in various angles.
                </p>
                <h3>Finalizing Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Refine the design based on feedback and create final line art and coloring to complete the character design.
